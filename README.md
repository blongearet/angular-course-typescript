## Getting things done ðŸ˜Ž

1. Clone this project on your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to grab all dependencies
3. For each step (01 to 09) run these command in two separated terminal

- `npm run start-01` (to compile TS files into JS files)
- `npm run test-01` (to run JS test files)

4. While there is error, find a fix ðŸ˜Ž

- First, fix the compilation error (start command) by fix syntaxic error
- Second, fix the test by updating the part with an underscore (`_`) in test files :)
